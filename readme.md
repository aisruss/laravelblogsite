# laravelblogsite
 Sample Laravel blog site I developed while learning Laravel. 

Features:
- Auth login for users to create accounts
- Blog system to add posts and comment on them

* uses migrations to create database tables
* uses persisters & eloquent repositories to handle the form requests, as well as a refinery to handle data formatting
